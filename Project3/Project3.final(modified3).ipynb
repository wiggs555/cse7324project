    "Austin Animal Center is the largest no-kill shelter in the United States and provides shelter to more than 16,000 animals each year. As a no-kill shelter they refuse to euthanize any animal unless the animal has a terminal medical issue and is in pain or if the animal is a danger to the public or to the shelter staff. Although the shelter’s primary goal is to find ‘forever homes’ for each and every animal that comes through their doors, many animals end up staying in the shelter for a long time if they are not considered as desirable for adoption as other animals. In addition to adopting out animals, the Austin Animal Center partners with various other rescues and animal sanctuaries to try to find homes for their animals. \n",
    "\n",
    "The average annual cost per animal at the Austin Animal Center is approximately $715 [3] and with many animals staying at the facility for long periods of time, some for several years, the cost can add up quickly. The shelter has fixed financial support via legislation to cover costs for staffing the shelters and a few grants to cover veterinary staff and services, but the shelter primarily relies on donations to provide for food, bedding and toys for the animals. The shelter must try to minimize costs associated with each animal and try to have the animals leave the shelter through adoption or transfer to a sanctuary as quickly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Austin Animal Center keeps track of each animal that comes through their doors and keeps a record of the animal’s outcome; that is whether they were adopted, transferred to a partner shelter or sanctuary or one of many other outcomes. If the shelter could predict an animal’s outcome based on the animal’s characteristics, they could be much more efficient with having animals leave the shelter by knowing which animals they should be able to adopt out and which animals they should transfer to other shelters or sanctuaries. This added efficiency would result in the shelter’s ability to take in more animals which in return would lower the average cost per animal.\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab examines the Austin Animal Center animal outcome data set to specifically look at cats and the outcome of each cat and attempts to build an accurate model of predicting the outcome. If accurate, this model could serve the Austin Animal Center as well as other cities that are looking at issuing a no-kill ordinance for their shelters."

    "We chose some initial parameters to try on based on professor's suggestions. After several trials, we decided to use these parameters because they did not require much time consumption and they provided the best results among trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using trial and error to obtain optimized parameters for classification does not seem to be \"data snooping\" of the negative kind in the typical sense. Data snooping is the \"misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant when in fact there is no real underlying effect.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) In our case, we are pursuing optimal parameters that enable the highest accuracy classification possible. No matter what methods we use to obtain a model that accurately predicts classes for training data, it does not matter if the same is not also true for new, untrained data. If our classification algorithm is negatively impacted by our tweaking of parameters for new instances of data, then the tweaking of these parameters would be unjustified.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since our goal is only to build the best classification tool possible, any means that improve that capability would be permissible, including adjusting parameters such as the regularization term - assuming they contribute to an increase in overall classification performance for untrained data."

    "### Observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "1-the figures above shows the accuracy and time consumption for various optimization techniques, BFGS with 10 iterations has the highest accuracy with a low delay and L2 regulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "2- stochastic has different accuracy values for different runs with the same parameters which mean the logistic regression got stuck in a local minimum depending on the initial value of the gradient and the direction \n",
    "\n",
    "3- steepest decent and most of the other optimization techniques returned a better accuracy for a lower C which means stronger regularization prevent from overfitting the data and in return has a better performance    \n",
    "\n",
    "4-  BFGS did better than hessian in terms of accuracy and time consumption which means that hessian is highly computational epically in calculating the second order derivative and inverting the hessian matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "5- the output classification had a count per classifier shown in the figure above in the data understanding section all the low count have been given the same class because there is not enough data to train a classifier \n",
    "\n",
    "6- the data is preprocessed such that its distribution will have a mean value 0 and standard deviation of 1. Given the distribution of the data, each value in the dataset will have the sample mean value subtracted, and then divided by the standard deviation of the whole dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### parameters justification\n",
    "\n",
    "parameters that resulted in the best accuracy and time consuption was chosen useing try and erorr , we started on initial parameters based on professor's suggestions\n",
    "\n",
    "Using trial and error to obtain optimized parameters for classification does not seem to be \"data snooping\" of the negative kind in the typical sense. Data snooping is the \"misuse of data analysis to find patterns in data that can be presented as statistically significant when in fact there is no real underlying effect.\" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_dredging) In our case, we are pursuing optimal parameters that enable the highest accuracy classification possible. No matter what methods we use to obtain a model that accurately predicts classes for training data, it does not matter if the same is not also true for new, untrained data. If our classification algorithm is negatively impacted by our tweaking of parameters for new instances of data, then the tweaking of these parameters would be unjustified.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, since our goal is only to build the best classification tool possible, any means that improve that capability would be permissible, including adjusting parameters such as the regularization term - assuming they contribute to an increase in overall classification performance for untrained data.\n",
